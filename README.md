# Endovascular-Tool-Segmentation-and-Tracking
Development of segmentation and tracking of endovascular tool during robotic cardiac catheterization. Published in Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery
In this study, a segmentation method was developed for automatic detection and tracking of guidewire pixels in X-ray angiograms. Image frames were acquired during robotic intravascular
catheterization for cardiac interventions. For segmentation, multiscale enhancement filtering was applied on preprocessed X-ray angiograms, while morphological operations and filters were applied to refine the frames
for pixel intensity adjustment and vesselness measurement. Minima and maxima extrema of the pixels were obtained to detect guidewire pixels in the X-ray frames. Lastly, morphological operation was applied for
guidewire pixel connectivity and tracking in segmented pixels. Method validation was performed on 12 X-ray angiogram sequences which were acquired during in vivo intravascular catheterization trials in rabbits.
